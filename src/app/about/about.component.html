<dt class="col-sm-3"><h4>What's a natal chart?</h4></dt>
<dd class="col-sm-9">A natal chart is an astronomical set of data that corresponds with the positions of the planets observed from a geocentric origin at the moment of your birth. Most of us are aware of our Sun's placement in our natal charts. As the planets progress through their differing orbit patterns, their unique positionings (reffered to in degrees) also have specific sign placements. Content on interpreting your natal chart is abundant, but our best advice is to start from the top down. Faster moving planets represent more personal energies, while slower moving planets begin to define generational shifts in thought. For instance people born between November 1983 and November 1995 all have their Pluto in some degrees of Scorpio. Pluto is a planet that defines revolutionary energy, power dynamics, and destructive forces. The generation with Pluto in Scorpio (Millenials and on) ascribes to this Plutonian energy with the affect of the Scorpionic archetype, one that is dark, mysterious, and truth seeking by definition. At AstroCult, we believe the best way to begin your study of astrology is through taking a thoughtful look at your personal natal chart. There is an astrological interpreter inside all of us.</dd>

<dt class="col-sm-3"><h4>Why astrology?</h4></dt>
<dd class="col-sm-9">An understanding of the 12 zodical archetypes and 11+ planetary archetypes as they exist within our personal natal charts, and modern society, is the fundamental responsibility of the practicing empath. These archetypes exist regardless of our identification of their structure. Occult, metaphysical, and ancient tools such as astrology, experimental art, the tarot, and mythological literature can help us to decode the paradigm that we have incarnated in.</dd>
